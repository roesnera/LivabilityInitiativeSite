<h1>Hello, Magicians</h1>
<p>My proposed handoff protocol is listed below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Magicians fork this repository and upload the WordPress theme that they have as-is to the forked repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the theme is uploaded, make a pull request to the main branch of the original repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will work to get the site hosted and deployed, and generally take over the DevOps side of the site.
  </li>
  <li>
    You all can continue to work on the features that you are still finishing, then just update and/or make a pull request when you have completed them.
  </li>
</ol>
